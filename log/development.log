Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer."], ["created_at", "2016-07-31 23:56:25.702829"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-31 23:56:25.702829"]]

It's been an incredible ride since our first brew, a little like a roller coaster!\n\nOur Brewing philosophy is simple, to brew memorable and flavourful beers regardless of the style...from our session beers to our Brewmaster's Reserve series. Our award winning beers are brewed by German trained Stefan Buhl and his team of passionate brewers. Using 100% Malted Barley, the Finest Hops, Yeast and Water, sure to satisfy the most discriminating tastes.\n\nAs a locally owned and operated Brewery, we believe in giving back to the communities that we work, live and play. From partnerships with the BC Fire ReLeaf Fund, Cops For Kids, Ski To Sea and the many charitable donations made throughout the year.\n\nSo when in Kelowna, drop by for a visit and we'll show you firsthand how to make great Craft beer!"], ["imgUrl", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/LVjHK1/upload_KTJYSh-medium.png"], ["website", "http://www.treebeer.com"], ["created_at", "2016-07-31 23:56:50.713611"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-31 23:56:50.713611"]]

Are you asking yourself, “What the hell are they talking about?”\n\nprocessIt goes like this. British monks loved to put their bald heads together, eat gruel and make killer good beer. Let’s face it. This was the Middle Ages, the insulation in those drafty monasteries sucked, so beer making kept them busy, and after a few pints, who gave a damn about the cold.\n\nBut these dudes were on to something. Using only barley, wheat, hops and pure water and being tight-assed about things like purity (they were monks after-all), they developed a system for making beer that has stood the test of time. And you thought ancient purity laws has something to do with chastity.\n\nThat same British monk-inspired beer yeast begat yeast off-spring. It is from this very same yeast that we make our beers. How’s that for a DNA profile?\n\nBut we’ve taken things a step further. We use the Peter Austin Brick Kettle Brewing System. For you non-beer geeks Peter Austin was The Granddaddy High Brew Master of Microbrewing. This was the man who started it all.\n\nThe Peter Austin system is a direct-fired, brick clad, copper whirlpool and hop percolator, and you cannot buy it at Costco when you get a Vitamix. The Austin system is a rugged, reliable and easy to operate, clean and maintain.\n\nThere are more than 100 Peter Austin Brewing Systems installed worldwide, but Four Mile Brewery is the only brewery in Western North America using his system.\n\nAlthough Peter Austin has left this mortal coil for a beer garden in the sky, his gifted protégé carries on his vision.\n\nAlan Pugsley is our Brew Master at Four Mile. Pugsley is not just our brew master. He travels around waving his frothy magic wand amongst all his other projects around the world. What is distinctive to Alan’s process is his know-how when developing beer recipes. His recipes honour true British beer making while masterfully tweaking things to incorporate regional ingredients while developing taste profiles that appeal to local palates.\n\nAs Peter Austin taught Alan Pugsley, so too did Pugsley teach our own resident brewer, Doug White. White is part of the family clan at Four Mile. In 1985 he headed off on a beer quest walk-about.\n\nHe got as far as England, Ringwood Brewery and Alan Pugsley. He apprenticed with them, and then, upon his return, took further training the University of California, David Campus, in brewing sciences. For White, craft brewing is a hands-on art form, and the proof, dear drinker, can be worshipped from dainty sip to gusto guzzle."], ["imgUrl", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GSkOGp/upload_XzTGhh-medium.png"], ["website", "http://www.4milebrewingco.com"], ["created_at", "2016-07-31 23:57:03.316571"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-31 23:57:03.316571"]]

We start with water that has been purified by our in-house reverse osmosis system and then add the right amount of minerals specific to each style beer. This water is combined with the finest malted grain from Europe and North America.\n\nThe addition of hops chosen for their aroma and bitterness and the best yeast for each style of beer all mean that you can now enjoy a variety of tastes in beers that will tempt you to try them all. During the year we will introduce some very special limited edition beers that will be on tap for a short time only. Be sure to ask your server for these seasonal beers when available.\n\nAll of our beers are made in house using the best ingredients available. We don't filter or add any preservatives to our beer. By drinking our beers you are greatly reducing the impact on the environment. Our beer only has to travel 50 ft. to get to your table, so feel good about doing your part to save the world one beer at a time.

Begbie Brewing was founded by Bart and Tracey Larson. Their love of beer and the quest for mountain living lured them to move to Revelstoke to create the brewery in 1996. Bart has a Phd in nuclear physics, but he prefers to make beer not war, right here in Revelstoke. And Bart hasn't let all that education stop him from making great beer. In fact, he's managed to combine his scientific background with an artistic, if somewhat bohemian, flair for beermaking to create what The Globe and Mail and Vancouver Province newspapers have called some of the best suds around. \n\nBart's brewery skills are complemented by Tracey's tenacious management and marketing skills. Tracey has a degree in biology; but she too is immersed in the brewing business. She probably comes closest to using skills learned in courses such as zoology when calling on remote bars to demo cold Begbies to rowdy, and thirsty, patrons. \n\nThe brewery has seen expansion since it's beginnings. Most significantly, the brewery moved to a larger location downtown, in an old car dealership, which now includes a tasting area and retail space."], ["imgUrl", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bVrLGO/upload_lRNo9z-medium.png"], ["website", "http://www.mt-begbie.com/"], ["created_at", "2016-07-31 23:57:10.874946"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-31 23:57:10.874946"]]

In 2006 we decided to let the brewery evolve to an even more natural state, and by October of that year we were granted Certified Organic status. In a sense, we were getting back to our roots. People have been brewing organically for over 6000 years; the current practice of large-scale industrial farming with synthetic fertilizers and pesticides is an aberration of traditional farming, and therefore brewing, practices. Choosing organic production is also in keeping with the spirit of our home town of Nelson, a laid-back, progressive community nestled in the heart of the Kootenays. With limitless backcountry skiing and hiking at our back door, as well as a host of other outdoor activities year-round, brewing an organic beer in Nelson just seems like the natural thing to do.\n\nWhat does it mean to be organic? Organic certification is a guarantee that our beer and its ingredients were produced without the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, or genetic engineering. Our processes, cleaning and sanitation regimes must also adhere to a strict set of organic principles and be approved by our organic certification body. Being organic also signifies a commitment to environmental sustainability. Our goal is to eventually source all of our ingredients as locally as possible. Most of our barley is already malted right here in BC, and we are working with local farmers toward the planting of certified organic hops. Our spent materials are recycled by local farmers as feed and compost."], ["website", "http://nelsonbrewing.com/"], ["created_at", "2016-07-31 23:57:15.989582"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-31 23:57:15.989582"]]

All of our specialty malts are imported from the UK, as is our unique strain of yeast. The ales are naturally carbonated and left to settle or \"fine\" at cold temperatures, rather than being filtered. Filtration can remove much of the goodness from beer along with the haze. Another negative practice our Brewer avoids is pasteurization.

Well, it represents the natural beauty of British Columbia and the passion for all things natural and hand crafted, just like our beer. It's been an incredible ride since our first brew, a little like a roller coaster!\n\nOur Brewing philosophy is simple, to brew memorable and flavourful beers regardless of the style...from our session beers to our Brewmaster's Reserve series. Our award winning beers are brewed by German trained Stefan Buhl and his team of passionate brewers. Using 100% Malted Barley, the Finest Hops, Yeast and Water, sure to satisfy the most discriminating tastes.\n\nAs a locally owned and operated Brewery, we believe in giving back to the communities that we work, live and play. From partnerships with the BC Fire ReLeaf Fund, Cops For Kids, Ski To Sea and the many charitable donations made throughout the year.\n\nSo when in Kelowna, drop by for a visit and we'll show you firsthand how to make great Craft beer!"], ["imgUrl", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/LVjHK1/upload_KTJYSh-medium.png"], ["website", "http://www.treebeer.com"], ["created_at", "2016-07-30 18:52:41.045793"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-30 18:52:41.045793"]]

Are you asking yourself, “What the hell are they talking about?”\n\nprocessIt goes like this. British monks loved to put their bald heads together, eat gruel and make killer good beer. Let’s face it. This was the Middle Ages, the insulation in those drafty monasteries sucked, so beer making kept them busy, and after a few pints, who gave a damn about the cold.\n\nBut these dudes were on to something. Using only barley, wheat, hops and pure water and being tight-assed about things like purity (they were monks after-all), they developed a system for making beer that has stood the test of time. And you thought ancient purity laws has something to do with chastity.\n\nThat same British monk-inspired beer yeast begat yeast off-spring. It is from this very same yeast that we make our beers. How’s that for a DNA profile?\n\nBut we’ve taken things a step further. We use the Peter Austin Brick Kettle Brewing System. For you non-beer geeks Peter Austin was The Granddaddy High Brew Master of Microbrewing. This was the man who started it all.\n\nThe Peter Austin system is a direct-fired, brick clad, copper whirlpool and hop percolator, and you cannot buy it at Costco when you get a Vitamix. The Austin system is a rugged, reliable and easy to operate, clean and maintain.\n\nThere are more than 100 Peter Austin Brewing Systems installed worldwide, but Four Mile Brewery is the only brewery in Western North America using his system.\n\nAlthough Peter Austin has left this mortal coil for a beer garden in the sky, his gifted protégé carries on his vision.\n\nAlan Pugsley is our Brew Master at Four Mile. Pugsley is not just our brew master. He travels around waving his frothy magic wand amongst all his other projects around the world. What is distinctive to Alan’s process is his know-how when developing beer recipes. His recipes honour true British beer making while masterfully tweaking things to incorporate regional ingredients while developing taste profiles that appeal to local palates.\n\nAs Peter Austin taught Alan Pugsley, so too did Pugsley teach our own resident brewer, Doug White. White is part of the family clan at Four Mile. In 1985 he headed off on a beer quest walk-about.\n\nHe got as far as England, Ringwood Brewery and Alan Pugsley. He apprenticed with them, and then, upon his return, took further training the University of California, David Campus, in brewing sciences. For White, craft brewing is a hands-on art form, and the proof, dear drinker, can be worshipped from dainty sip to gusto guzzle."], ["imgUrl", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GSkOGp/upload_XzTGhh-medium.png"], ["website", "http://www.4milebrewingco.com"], ["created_at", "2016-07-30 18:52:46.940273"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-30 18:52:46.940273"]]

Begbie Brewing was founded by Bart and Tracey Larson. Their love of beer and the quest for mountain living lured them to move to Revelstoke to create the brewery in 1996. Bart has a Phd in nuclear physics, but he prefers to make beer not war, right here in Revelstoke. And Bart hasn't let all that education stop him from making great beer. In fact, he's managed to combine his scientific background with an artistic, if somewhat bohemian, flair for beermaking to create what The Globe and Mail and Vancouver Province newspapers have called some of the best suds around. \n\nBart's brewery skills are complemented by Tracey's tenacious management and marketing skills. Tracey has a degree in biology; but she too is immersed in the brewing business. She probably comes closest to using skills learned in courses such as zoology when calling on remote bars to demo cold Begbies to rowdy, and thirsty, patrons. \n\nThe brewery has seen expansion since it's beginnings. Most significantly, the brewery moved to a larger location downtown, in an old car dealership, which now includes a tasting area and retail space."], ["imgUrl", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bVrLGO/upload_lRNo9z-medium.png"], ["website", "http://www.mt-begbie.com/"], ["created_at", "2016-07-30 18:52:52.003829"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-30 18:52:52.003829"]]

In 2006 we decided to let the brewery evolve to an even more natural state, and by October of that year we were granted Certified Organic status. In a sense, we were getting back to our roots. People have been brewing organically for over 6000 years; the current practice of large-scale industrial farming with synthetic fertilizers and pesticides is an aberration of traditional farming, and therefore brewing, practices. Choosing organic production is also in keeping with the spirit of our home town of Nelson, a laid-back, progressive community nestled in the heart of the Kootenays. With limitless backcountry skiing and hiking at our back door, as well as a host of other outdoor activities year-round, brewing an organic beer in Nelson just seems like the natural thing to do.\n\nWhat does it mean to be organic? Organic certification is a guarantee that our beer and its ingredients were produced without the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, or genetic engineering. Our processes, cleaning and sanitation regimes must also adhere to a strict set of organic principles and be approved by our organic certification body. Being organic also signifies a commitment to environmental sustainability. Our goal is to eventually source all of our ingredients as locally as possible. Most of our barley is already malted right here in BC, and we are working with local farmers toward the planting of certified organic hops. Our spent materials are recycled by local farmers as feed and compost."], ["website", "http://nelsonbrewing.com/"], ["created_at", "2016-07-30 18:52:54.193992"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-30 18:52:54.193992"]]

We brew a wide selection of British-style ales and German and Canadian beers that are created with old-world care and without compromise. No syrups, sugars or \"adjunct\" are used in our 100 percent grain mashes—only barley and wheat malts, plus oatmeal in our special stout. All of our specialty malts are imported from the UK, as is our unique strain of yeast. The ales are naturally carbonated and left to settle or \"fine\" at cold temperatures, rather than being filtered. Filtration can remove much of the goodness from beer along with the haze. Another negative practice our Brewer avoids is pasteurization. Our natural and healthy brews are more lightly carbonated than the factory product, and served at a palatable 45 degrees F to bring out the fullness of the flavour for which we strive."], ["imgUrl", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BMC26E/upload_u1MdsV-medium.png"], ["website", "http://swanshotel.com"], ["created_at", "2016-07-30 18:53:01.049917"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-30 18:53:01.049917"]]

These grain-based beers are brewed reflecting local beer culture (process, ingredients, climate, etc.). This category recognizes uniquely local or regional beer types and beers distinctively not defined in any recognized style in these guidelines. They may be light or dark, strong or weak, hoppy or not hoppy. They may have characters which are unique to yeast, fermentation techniques, aging conditions, carbonation level - or higher or lower levels of profound characters normally associated with other beer types. Examples of indigenous beers might include current day versions of highly regional and/or historic styles which are not represented elsewhere in these guidelines, such as Finnish-style sahti, S American chicha, African sorghum based beers, and others. Other examples might include beers made wholly unique by use of multiple local ingredients and/or techniques, with the resulting beer being highly representative of location, as well as differentiated from traditional beer style categories. Beers brewed with non-traditional hop varieties, grains, malt, yeast or other ingredient that still closely approximate an existing classical category would be more appropriately entered into the classical category. New and innovative beers that do not represent locally adopted techniques or grown ingredients would be more appropriately entered into the experimental category. Proper evaluation of entries in this category requires the need to provide  judges with additional information about the beer.  A written summary illustrating the intent, background, history, design and/or development of the beer as well as  describing any regional and/or stylistic context, choice of ingredients, process and any other unique information, helps establish a basis for comparison between highly diverse entries. Entering brewers must provide a statement of 100 words or less illustrating the above and why it is an indigenous beer without revealing the company's identity. This statement should be carefully crafted and will be evaluated by judges and carry significant weight in their decisions. Statements that contain information which might identify or otherwise create bias towards the entry will be modified by the Competition Manager. Entries not accompanied by this information will be at a profound disadvantage during judging."], ["created_at", "2016-07-30 21:32:48.298415"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-30 21:32:48.298415"]]

Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

Well, it represents the natural beauty of British Columbia and the passion for all things natural and hand crafted, just like our beer. It's been an incredible ride since our first brew, a little like a roller coaster!\n\nOur Brewing philosophy is simple, to brew memorable and flavourful beers regardless of the style...from our session beers to our Brewmaster's Reserve series. Our award winning beers are brewed by German trained Stefan Buhl and his team of passionate brewers. Using 100% Malted Barley, the Finest Hops, Yeast and Water, sure to satisfy the most discriminating tastes.\n\nAs a locally owned and operated Brewery, we believe in giving back to the communities that we work, live and play. From partnerships with the BC Fire ReLeaf Fund, Cops For Kids, Ski To Sea and the many charitable donations made throughout the year.\n\nSo when in Kelowna, drop by for a visit and we'll show you firsthand how to make great Craft beer!"], ["imgUrl", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/LVjHK1/upload_KTJYSh-medium.png"], ["website", "http://www.treebeer.com"], ["loc", "British Columbia"], ["created_at", "2016-07-30 21:33:01.407312"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-30 21:33:01.407312"]]

Are you asking yourself, “What the hell are they talking about?”\n\nprocessIt goes like this. British monks loved to put their bald heads together, eat gruel and make killer good beer. Let’s face it. This was the Middle Ages, the insulation in those drafty monasteries sucked, so beer making kept them busy, and after a few pints, who gave a damn about the cold.\n\nBut these dudes were on to something. Using only barley, wheat, hops and pure water and being tight-assed about things like purity (they were monks after-all), they developed a system for making beer that has stood the test of time. And you thought ancient purity laws has something to do with chastity.\n\nThat same British monk-inspired beer yeast begat yeast off-spring. It is from this very same yeast that we make our beers. How’s that for a DNA profile?\n\nBut we’ve taken things a step further. We use the Peter Austin Brick Kettle Brewing System. For you non-beer geeks Peter Austin was The Granddaddy High Brew Master of Microbrewing. This was the man who started it all.\n\nThe Peter Austin system is a direct-fired, brick clad, copper whirlpool and hop percolator, and you cannot buy it at Costco when you get a Vitamix. The Austin system is a rugged, reliable and easy to operate, clean and maintain.\n\nThere are more than 100 Peter Austin Brewing Systems installed worldwide, but Four Mile Brewery is the only brewery in Western North America using his system.\n\nAlthough Peter Austin has left this mortal coil for a beer garden in the sky, his gifted protégé carries on his vision.\n\nAlan Pugsley is our Brew Master at Four Mile. Pugsley is not just our brew master. He travels around waving his frothy magic wand amongst all his other projects around the world. What is distinctive to Alan’s process is his know-how when developing beer recipes. His recipes honour true British beer making while masterfully tweaking things to incorporate regional ingredients while developing taste profiles that appeal to local palates.\n\nAs Peter Austin taught Alan Pugsley, so too did Pugsley teach our own resident brewer, Doug White. White is part of the family clan at Four Mile. In 1985 he headed off on a beer quest walk-about.\n\nHe got as far as England, Ringwood Brewery and Alan Pugsley. He apprenticed with them, and then, upon his return, took further training the University of California, David Campus, in brewing sciences. For White, craft brewing is a hands-on art form, and the proof, dear drinker, can be worshipped from dainty sip to gusto guzzle."], ["imgUrl", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GSkOGp/upload_XzTGhh-medium.png"], ["website", "http://www.4milebrewingco.com"], ["loc", "British Columbia"], ["created_at", "2016-07-30 21:33:08.454072"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-30 21:33:08.454072"]]

We start with water that has been purified by our in-house reverse osmosis system and then add the right amount of minerals specific to each style beer. This water is combined with the finest malted grain from Europe and North America.\n\nThe addition of hops chosen for their aroma and bitterness and the best yeast for each style of beer all mean that you can now enjoy a variety of tastes in beers that will tempt you to try them all. During the year we will introduce some very special limited edition beers that will be on tap for a short time only. Be sure to ask your server for these seasonal beers when available.\n\nAll of our beers are made in house using the best ingredients available. We don't filter or add any preservatives to our beer. By drinking our beers you are greatly reducing the impact on the environment. Our beer only has to travel 50 ft. to get to your table, so feel good about doing your part to save the world one beer at a time.

Begbie Brewing was founded by Bart and Tracey Larson. Their love of beer and the quest for mountain living lured them to move to Revelstoke to create the brewery in 1996. Bart has a Phd in nuclear physics, but he prefers to make beer not war, right here in Revelstoke. And Bart hasn't let all that education stop him from making great beer. In fact, he's managed to combine his scientific background with an artistic, if somewhat bohemian, flair for beermaking to create what The Globe and Mail and Vancouver Province newspapers have called some of the best suds around. \n\nBart's brewery skills are complemented by Tracey's tenacious management and marketing skills. Tracey has a degree in biology; but she too is immersed in the brewing business. She probably comes closest to using skills learned in courses such as zoology when calling on remote bars to demo cold Begbies to rowdy, and thirsty, patrons. \n\nThe brewery has seen expansion since it's beginnings. Most significantly, the brewery moved to a larger location downtown, in an old car dealership, which now includes a tasting area and retail space."], ["imgUrl", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bVrLGO/upload_lRNo9z-medium.png"], ["website", "http://www.mt-begbie.com/"], ["loc", "British Columbia"], ["created_at", "2016-07-30 21:33:13.221941"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-30 21:33:13.221941"]]

In 2006 we decided to let the brewery evolve to an even more natural state, and by October of that year we were granted Certified Organic status. In a sense, we were getting back to our roots. People have been brewing organically for over 6000 years; the current practice of large-scale industrial farming with synthetic fertilizers and pesticides is an aberration of traditional farming, and therefore brewing, practices. Choosing organic production is also in keeping with the spirit of our home town of Nelson, a laid-back, progressive community nestled in the heart of the Kootenays. With limitless backcountry skiing and hiking at our back door, as well as a host of other outdoor activities year-round, brewing an organic beer in Nelson just seems like the natural thing to do.\n\nWhat does it mean to be organic? Organic certification is a guarantee that our beer and its ingredients were produced without the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, or genetic engineering. Our processes, cleaning and sanitation regimes must also adhere to a strict set of organic principles and be approved by our organic certification body. Being organic also signifies a commitment to environmental sustainability. Our goal is to eventually source all of our ingredients as locally as possible. Most of our barley is already malted right here in BC, and we are working with local farmers toward the planting of certified organic hops. Our spent materials are recycled by local farmers as feed and compost."], ["website", "http://nelsonbrewing.com/"], ["loc", "British Columbia"], ["created_at", "2016-07-30 21:33:15.453441"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-30 21:33:15.453441"]]

Mike, Nick, and Anthony had been avid home brewers and craft beer enthusiasts for years before they finally decided to turn their shared passion into a full time gig.\n\nIn 2008, the three friends quit their day jobs and opened a restaurant that quickly became known as a mecca for craft beer enthusiasts in Vancouver.  As the restaurant business thrived, the guys turned their attentions back to the enduring dream of opening their own brewery.\n\nThe guys decided that it was time to stop talking and start brewing.  They teamed up with Graham With, a respected home brewer; and Michael Tod, a friend with a wealth of sales experience in the BC craft beer industry.  The newly assembled Parallel 49 team set out to create the unique brand of Vancouver craft beer that they had been thirsting after for years."], ["imgUrl", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oZ1O3I/upload_P8kxtU-medium.png"], ["website", "http://parallel49brewing.com"], ["loc", "British Columbia"], ["created_at", "2016-07-30 21:33:18.882403"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-30 21:33:18.882403"]]

Malts from Canada, England and Germany have been hand pick to produce a strong base in our brews. Hops, like grapes, are influenced by the territory, so if a beer style calls for hops from Germany we get hops from Germany. We love our ingredients so much we are planting our very own Hop yard at the Phillips Farm in Manotick, there we will grow specialty hops exclusively for our local brews. Our heritage yeast is housed in a special yeast laboratory to ensure the consistency and freshness of our brews. Our water is double filtered and boiled to give us a “clean slate”, and to finish it off we adjust the natural flavor compounds in the water to suit our various beer styles.\n\nGood ingredients are the start of a great brew…\n\nWe use time honored and perfected brewing traditions that have been passed down from brewmaster to brewmaster for centuries. These methods are steeped in artisan spirit and have the precision of science. Using these methods, with our state of the art brewing system allows us to produce hand crafted beers that are pure, free of added chemicals and preservatives, full of flavor and rich in character. \nGenerations of brewers have combined their knowledge to bring you this pint\nPassion for the craft of beer is in every batch we make. Our brewmaster makes beer because he loves beer. The satisfaction of a job well done is confirmed with the good times, new friendships and community that is formed around sharing a great pint.\n\nFor the Love of Beer"], ["imgUrl", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Kx8Y6c/upload_NpH6RE-medium.png"], ["website", "http://BigRigBrew.com"], ["loc", "Ontario"], ["created_at", "2016-07-31 01:44:02.199126"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-31 01:44:02.199126"]]

Something that\nthey could believe in, a sessionable, flavour packed beer that would not only inspire, but also wake the senses of the beer drinker. A\ncomplex but fun beer. No compromises, adhering to the purist quality in brewing. This idea has been discussed over and over, always in the\nback of their minds. Sometimes the timing just wasn’t right, but in 2012 all their bottles have aligned.\n\nFrom being in the beer industry so many years, we decided to plan, we wanted to bring a small batch brewed craft beer that we would love, and one the average Canadian beer consumer would too.\n\nWe contacted an old friend and craft brewer with our thoughts. We talked obsessivly about the beer we needed to create. From the passion came the experiments, the tastings and the refinements, until we had something that we knew was special.\n\nNo investors, just what we managed to scrape together and fueled by a passion for craft beer. Taking a chance to do what you love and believe in is what Double trouble Brewing Co. is all about. This is how everything good starts. The first step is the biggest.

Beginning in 1996 with their now-famous Raspberry Wheat Ale and Pale Ale as draught-only selections in Ontario pubs, the brewery developed a strong following with beer connoisseurs.\n\nThe brewery added Nut Brown Ale and Cream Ale to their slate, and offered their ales in oversize 473mL bottles for sale at only at the brewery. This led to many beer pilgrimages by this writer to Peterborough to satisfy my thirst.\n\nLuckily, Kawartha Lakes now distributes their Raspberry Wheat and Cream Ale in 12-packs in a growing number of Beer Stores. Due to the immense popularity of KLB beers, their Nut Brown Ale will also be available in Beer Stores beginning in September. Drinkers who desire their fine Pale Ale must still trek up to Central Ontario, but hopefully this brew will follow sometime in the future and round out their slate.\n\nKawartha Lakes was recently written up in the National Post, with the headline on March 8 reading: \"The last thing thriving Kawartha Lakes Brewing needs is more customers\". It is great to see an Ontario microbrewery succeeding, which has been something of a rarity in this province's microbrewery industry over the last few years."], ["loc", "Ontario"], ["created_at", "2016-07-31 01:44:07.139533"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-31 01:44:07.139533"]]

His ambition was simple: to brew only the highest quality beer, made with the best ingredients, using absolutely no preservatives, additives or chemicals.\n\nFrom the beginning, Cool didn’t focus on marketing and promotions. The Company concentrated on the product and the brewing process. Headquartered in Brampton, Ontario, the once-tiny Brewery grew steadily as its Cool Beer brand became increasingly successful. So much so, Cool had to expand its operations a number of times.\n\nBut the commitment to quality never changed.\n\nBy 2003, Cool was sufficiently well-established for the Brewery to launch another high-quality beer, new Millennium Buzz Beer. Buzz is a refreshing red lager which has also proved to be a resounding success.\n\nBoth Cool and Buzz will always be made with the finest ingredients, contain no additives whatsoever, and be put through the Brewery’s advanced cold-filtration system that makes them two of the most refreshing and thirst-quenching beers available. Judging by their success, a commitment to quality still pays off!"], ["imgUrl", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/g1v6tM/upload_orV3ia-medium.png"], ["website", "http://www.coolbeer.com/"], ["loc", "Ontario"], ["created_at", "2016-07-31 01:44:08.369199"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-31 01:44:08.369199"]]

We take pride in sourcing the best possible ingredients from around the world and from our own back yard. Malts from Canada, England and Germany have been hand pick to produce a strong base in our brews. Hops, like grapes, are influenced by the territory, so if a beer style calls for hops from Germany we get hops from Germany. We love our ingredients so much we are planting our very own Hop yard at the Phillips Farm in Manotick, there we will grow specialty hops exclusively for our local brews. Our heritage yeast is housed in a special yeast laboratory to ensure the consistency and freshness of our brews. Our water is double filtered and boiled to give us a “clean slate”, and to finish it off we adjust the natural flavor compounds in the water to suit our various beer styles.\n\nGood ingredients are the start of a great brew…\n\nWe use time honored and perfected brewing traditions that have been passed down from brewmaster to brewmaster for centuries. These methods are steeped in artisan spirit and have the precision of science. Using these methods, with our state of the art brewing system allows us to produce hand crafted beers that are pure, free of added chemicals and preservatives, full of flavor and rich in character. \nGenerations of brewers have combined their knowledge to bring you this pint\nPassion for the craft of beer is in every batch we make. Our brewmaster makes beer because he loves beer. The satisfaction of a job well done is confirmed with the good times, new friendships and community that is formed around sharing a great pint.\n\nFor the Love of Beer"], ["imgUrl", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Kx8Y6c/upload_NpH6RE-medium.png"], ["website", "http://BigRigBrew.com"], ["loc", "Ontario"], ["created_at", "2016-07-31 01:51:59.768702"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-31 01:51:59.768702"]]

Something that\nthey could believe in, a sessionable, flavour packed beer that would not only inspire, but also wake the senses of the beer drinker. A\ncomplex but fun beer. No compromises, adhering to the purist quality in brewing. This idea has been discussed over and over, always in the\nback of their minds. Sometimes the timing just wasn’t right, but in 2012 all their bottles have aligned.\n\nFrom being in the beer industry so many years, we decided to plan, we wanted to bring a small batch brewed craft beer that we would love, and one the average Canadian beer consumer would too.\n\nWe contacted an old friend and craft brewer with our thoughts. We talked obsessivly about the beer we needed to create. From the passion came the experiments, the tastings and the refinements, until we had something that we knew was special.\n\nNo investors, just what we managed to scrape together and fueled by a passion for craft beer. Taking a chance to do what you love and believe in is what Double trouble Brewing Co. is all about. This is how everything good starts. The first step is the biggest.

Beginning in 1996 with their now-famous Raspberry Wheat Ale and Pale Ale as draught-only selections in Ontario pubs, the brewery developed a strong following with beer connoisseurs.\n\nThe brewery added Nut Brown Ale and Cream Ale to their slate, and offered their ales in oversize 473mL bottles for sale at only at the brewery. This led to many beer pilgrimages by this writer to Peterborough to satisfy my thirst.\n\nLuckily, Kawartha Lakes now distributes their Raspberry Wheat and Cream Ale in 12-packs in a growing number of Beer Stores. Due to the immense popularity of KLB beers, their Nut Brown Ale will also be available in Beer Stores beginning in September. Drinkers who desire their fine Pale Ale must still trek up to Central Ontario, but hopefully this brew will follow sometime in the future and round out their slate.\n\nKawartha Lakes was recently written up in the National Post, with the headline on March 8 reading: \"The last thing thriving Kawartha Lakes Brewing needs is more customers\". It is great to see an Ontario microbrewery succeeding, which has been something of a rarity in this province's microbrewery industry over the last few years."], ["loc", "Ontario"], ["created_at", "2016-07-31 01:52:03.796445"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-31 01:52:03.796445"]]

His ambition was simple: to brew only the highest quality beer, made with the best ingredients, using absolutely no preservatives, additives or chemicals.\n\nFrom the beginning, Cool didn’t focus on marketing and promotions. The Company concentrated on the product and the brewing process. Headquartered in Brampton, Ontario, the once-tiny Brewery grew steadily as its Cool Beer brand became increasingly successful. So much so, Cool had to expand its operations a number of times.\n\nBut the commitment to quality never changed.\n\nBy 2003, Cool was sufficiently well-established for the Brewery to launch another high-quality beer, new Millennium Buzz Beer. Buzz is a refreshing red lager which has also proved to be a resounding success.\n\nBoth Cool and Buzz will always be made with the finest ingredients, contain no additives whatsoever, and be put through the Brewery’s advanced cold-filtration system that makes them two of the most refreshing and thirst-quenching beers available. Judging by their success, a commitment to quality still pays off!"], ["imgUrl", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/g1v6tM/upload_orV3ia-medium.png"], ["website", "http://www.coolbeer.com/"], ["loc", "Ontario"], ["created_at", "2016-07-31 01:52:04.745274"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-31 01:52:04.745274"]]

Malts from Canada, England and Germany have been hand pick to produce a strong base in our brews. Hops, like grapes, are influenced by the territory, so if a beer style calls for hops from Germany we get hops from Germany. We love our ingredients so much we are planting our very own Hop yard at the Phillips Farm in Manotick, there we will grow specialty hops exclusively for our local brews. Our heritage yeast is housed in a special yeast laboratory to ensure the consistency and freshness of our brews. Our water is double filtered and boiled to give us a “clean slate”, and to finish it off we adjust the natural flavor compounds in the water to suit our various beer styles.\n\nGood ingredients are the start of a great brew…\n\nWe use time honored and perfected brewing traditions that have been passed down from brewmaster to brewmaster for centuries. These methods are steeped in artisan spirit and have the precision of science. Using these methods, with our state of the art brewing system allows us to produce hand crafted beers that are pure, free of added chemicals and preservatives, full of flavor and rich in character. \nGenerations of brewers have combined their knowledge to bring you this pint\nPassion for the craft of beer is in every batch we make. Our brewmaster makes beer because he loves beer. The satisfaction of a job well done is confirmed with the good times, new friendships and community that is formed around sharing a great pint.\n\nFor the Love of Beer"], ["imgUrl", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Kx8Y6c/upload_NpH6RE-medium.png"], ["website", "http://BigRigBrew.com"], ["loc", "Ontario"], ["created_at", "2016-07-31 01:53:10.589432"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-31 01:53:10.589432"]]

Something that\nthey could believe in, a sessionable, flavour packed beer that would not only inspire, but also wake the senses of the beer drinker. A\ncomplex but fun beer. No compromises, adhering to the purist quality in brewing. This idea has been discussed over and over, always in the\nback of their minds. Sometimes the timing just wasn’t right, but in 2012 all their bottles have aligned.\n\nFrom being in the beer industry so many years, we decided to plan, we wanted to bring a small batch brewed craft beer that we would love, and one the average Canadian beer consumer would too.\n\nWe contacted an old friend and craft brewer with our thoughts. We talked obsessivly about the beer we needed to create. From the passion came the experiments, the tastings and the refinements, until we had something that we knew was special.\n\nNo investors, just what we managed to scrape together and fueled by a passion for craft beer. Taking a chance to do what you love and believe in is what Double trouble Brewing Co. is all about. This is how everything good starts. The first step is the biggest.

Beginning in 1996 with their now-famous Raspberry Wheat Ale and Pale Ale as draught-only selections in Ontario pubs, the brewery developed a strong following with beer connoisseurs.\n\nThe brewery added Nut Brown Ale and Cream Ale to their slate, and offered their ales in oversize 473mL bottles for sale at only at the brewery. This led to many beer pilgrimages by this writer to Peterborough to satisfy my thirst.\n\nLuckily, Kawartha Lakes now distributes their Raspberry Wheat and Cream Ale in 12-packs in a growing number of Beer Stores. Due to the immense popularity of KLB beers, their Nut Brown Ale will also be available in Beer Stores beginning in September. Drinkers who desire their fine Pale Ale must still trek up to Central Ontario, but hopefully this brew will follow sometime in the future and round out their slate.\n\nKawartha Lakes was recently written up in the National Post, with the headline on March 8 reading: \"The last thing thriving Kawartha Lakes Brewing needs is more customers\". It is great to see an Ontario microbrewery succeeding, which has been something of a rarity in this province's microbrewery industry over the last few years."], ["loc", "Ontario"], ["created_at", "2016-07-31 01:53:16.728102"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-31 01:53:16.728102"]]

His ambition was simple: to brew only the highest quality beer, made with the best ingredients, using absolutely no preservatives, additives or chemicals.\n\nFrom the beginning, Cool didn’t focus on marketing and promotions. The Company concentrated on the product and the brewing process. Headquartered in Brampton, Ontario, the once-tiny Brewery grew steadily as its Cool Beer brand became increasingly successful. So much so, Cool had to expand its operations a number of times.\n\nBut the commitment to quality never changed.\n\nBy 2003, Cool was sufficiently well-established for the Brewery to launch another high-quality beer, new Millennium Buzz Beer. Buzz is a refreshing red lager which has also proved to be a resounding success.\n\nBoth Cool and Buzz will always be made with the finest ingredients, contain no additives whatsoever, and be put through the Brewery’s advanced cold-filtration system that makes them two of the most refreshing and thirst-quenching beers available. Judging by their success, a commitment to quality still pays off!"], ["imgUrl", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/g1v6tM/upload_orV3ia-medium.png"], ["website", "http://www.coolbeer.com/"], ["loc", "Ontario"], ["created_at", "2016-07-31 01:53:18.620779"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-31 01:53:18.620779"]]

Our Brewmasters do everything by hand on a small scale. It's a great place to learn about beer because, unlike a modern commercial brewery, you can see every step in the process for yourself. And, no one else has a Brewmaster ready to welcome visitors in period costume.\n\nIn the 1860s there were 155 registered breweries in Ontario, and countless smaller operations. Black Creek Historic Brewery is the first in this province to replicate the brewing processes of that era, when there was no electricity or refrigeration, no stainless steel tanks or bottling plants.\n\nThe equipment at Black Creek Historic Brewery is made mainly of wood and copper, and the beer ferments the way it was done in the old days, with wooden barrels to age the beer. Malted barley is shoveled by hand into the wort tun where it is boiled into a mash. After filtering the solids through a linen cloth, the sugary liquid is boiled and hops are added, both for flavouring and as a natural preservative. Once the boiling is complete, the beer is put in barrels where the yeast is added. A short time later, the beer is ready!\n\nVisitors can sample the beer at cellar temperature, the way it was enjoyed in the past, or drink a chilled pint in the pub, the way many people prefer it today. Either way, you’ll be tasting the authentic flavours of ales and porters made by hand, using only natural ingredients and genuine period recipes.\n\nVisit the Black Creek Historic Brewery. It’s interesting. It’s fun. And the beer is great!"], ["imgUrl", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Cl1sHc/upload_WVifE0-medium.png"], ["website", "http://www.blackcreekbrewery.ca/"], ["loc", "Ontario"], ["created_at", "2016-07-31 01:53:26.022449"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-31 01:53:26.022449"]]

(In North America hard cider is an alcoholic drink made from fermented apple juice.) Carefully crafted from the best apples grown on our family farm and nearby orchards, our ciders are made with 100% pure apple juice.\n\nLocated on the picturesque island of Prince Edward County in Southeastern Ontario, our tasting room and retail store welcomes visitors from May to November. Come visit us or look for County Cider Co. products at restaurants, bars and LCBO stores\n\nThe County Cider Company is located on Ontario’s island of Prince Edward County. Most famous for the giant sand dunes and golden beaches of Sandbanks Provincial Park, the County also enjoys a dramatic history.\n\nFollowing the American Revolution of 1776 the Township of Marysburgh—home to the County Cider Co.—was one of many established for the settlement of United Empire Loyalists. Named in honour of Princess Mary, a daughter of King George III, it became home to a small group of disbanded German mercenaries under former Lieutenant Baron von Reitzenstein. This party, numbering about 40 persons, was one of the earliest German-speaking groups to settle in Ontario. By October 1784 they had begun to clear and cultivate the land. Henry David and his wife Elizabeth were among these early settlers and it was in 1830, that their son Conrad David, was given title to the lot, which the County Cider Co. now calls home.\n\nconradhouseToday, the 1832 Conrad David House is an area landmark. Set on the brow of the Waupoos escarpment, the stone house is an excellent example of Regency Cottage architecture. It features dramatic French doors, over-sized windows and veranda as well as a hipped roof. Next door, the property’s picturesque 1832 stone barn houses the County Cider Co.’s tasting room and retail store. Visitors are invited to take advantage of the million-dollar view of Lake Ontario from our patio and enjoy a cold, refreshing cider and a light lunch."], ["imgUrl", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/X2f0T4/upload_dor90I-medium.png"], ["website", "https://www.countycider.com"], ["loc", "Ontario"], ["created_at", "2016-07-31 01:53:31.305178"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-31 01:53:31.305178"]]

The concept was simple: make a variety of beers that WE wanted to drink and create a tasting opportunity for our customers to come into the brewery to decide what they liked, and buy to go.\n\nDuring our first year of operation we released over 20 different beers, underwent one expansion, and our MO remains the same as it was in the beginning. In addition to the retail store our beers can also be found in over 30 local bars and restaurants.\n\nYou can be sure when you pick up a glass or bottle of our beer that you’re drinking a fresh local product. We work that little old brew house like a pack mule to crank out as much beer as possible. Nearly all of our beer is sold to customers within a week of leaving our brite tanks.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer."], ["created_at", "2016-07-31 02:11:16.685403"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-31 02:11:16.685403"]]

Malts from Canada, England and Germany have been hand pick to produce a strong base in our brews. Hops, like grapes, are influenced by the territory, so if a beer style calls for hops from Germany we get hops from Germany. We love our ingredients so much we are planting our very own Hop yard at the Phillips Farm in Manotick, there we will grow specialty hops exclusively for our local brews. Our heritage yeast is housed in a special yeast laboratory to ensure the consistency and freshness of our brews. Our water is double filtered and boiled to give us a “clean slate”, and to finish it off we adjust the natural flavor compounds in the water to suit our various beer styles.\n\nGood ingredients are the start of a great brew…\n\nWe use time honored and perfected brewing traditions that have been passed down from brewmaster to brewmaster for centuries. These methods are steeped in artisan spirit and have the precision of science. Using these methods, with our state of the art brewing system allows us to produce hand crafted beers that are pure, free of added chemicals and preservatives, full of flavor and rich in character. \nGenerations of brewers have combined their knowledge to bring you this pint\nPassion for the craft of beer is in every batch we make. Our brewmaster makes beer because he loves beer. The satisfaction of a job well done is confirmed with the good times, new friendships and community that is formed around sharing a great pint.\n\nFor the Love of Beer"], ["imgUrl", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Kx8Y6c/upload_NpH6RE-medium.png"], ["website", "http://BigRigBrew.com"], ["loc", "Ontario"], ["created_at", "2016-07-31 02:11:21.589812"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-31 02:11:21.589812"]]

From there both\nNathan and Claude have worked in the craft brew industry. They’ve always joked and talked about having their own beer. Something that\nthey could believe in, a sessionable, flavour packed beer that would not only inspire, but also wake the senses of the beer drinker. A\ncomplex but fun beer. No compromises, adhering to the purist quality in brewing. This idea has been discussed over and over, always in the\nback of their minds. Sometimes the timing just wasn’t right, but in 2012 all their bottles have aligned.\n\nFrom being in the beer industry so many years, we decided to plan, we wanted to bring a small batch brewed craft beer that we would love, and one the average Canadian beer consumer would too.\n\nWe contacted an old friend and craft brewer with our thoughts. We talked obsessivly about the beer we needed to create. From the passion came the experiments, the tastings and the refinements, until we had something that we knew was special.\n\nNo investors, just what we managed to scrape together and fueled by a passion for craft beer. Taking a chance to do what you love and believe in is what Double trouble Brewing Co. is all about. This is how everything good starts. The first step is the biggest.

Beginning in 1996 with their now-famous Raspberry Wheat Ale and Pale Ale as draught-only selections in Ontario pubs, the brewery developed a strong following with beer connoisseurs.\n\nThe brewery added Nut Brown Ale and Cream Ale to their slate, and offered their ales in oversize 473mL bottles for sale at only at the brewery. This led to many beer pilgrimages by this writer to Peterborough to satisfy my thirst.\n\nLuckily, Kawartha Lakes now distributes their Raspberry Wheat and Cream Ale in 12-packs in a growing number of Beer Stores. Due to the immense popularity of KLB beers, their Nut Brown Ale will also be available in Beer Stores beginning in September. Drinkers who desire their fine Pale Ale must still trek up to Central Ontario, but hopefully this brew will follow sometime in the future and round out their slate.\n\nKawartha Lakes was recently written up in the National Post, with the headline on March 8 reading: \"The last thing thriving Kawartha Lakes Brewing needs is more customers\". It is great to see an Ontario microbrewery succeeding, which has been something of a rarity in this province's microbrewery industry over the last few years."], ["loc", "Ontario"], ["created_at", "2016-07-31 02:11:27.926175"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-31 02:11:27.926175"]]

His ambition was simple: to brew only the highest quality beer, made with the best ingredients, using absolutely no preservatives, additives or chemicals.\n\nFrom the beginning, Cool didn’t focus on marketing and promotions. The Company concentrated on the product and the brewing process. Headquartered in Brampton, Ontario, the once-tiny Brewery grew steadily as its Cool Beer brand became increasingly successful. So much so, Cool had to expand its operations a number of times.\n\nBut the commitment to quality never changed.\n\nBy 2003, Cool was sufficiently well-established for the Brewery to launch another high-quality beer, new Millennium Buzz Beer. Buzz is a refreshing red lager which has also proved to be a resounding success.\n\nBoth Cool and Buzz will always be made with the finest ingredients, contain no additives whatsoever, and be put through the Brewery’s advanced cold-filtration system that makes them two of the most refreshing and thirst-quenching beers available. Judging by their success, a commitment to quality still pays off!"], ["imgUrl", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/g1v6tM/upload_orV3ia-medium.png"], ["website", "http://www.coolbeer.com/"], ["loc", "Ontario"], ["created_at", "2016-07-31 02:11:29.635316"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-31 02:11:29.635316"]]

Our Brewmasters do everything by hand on a small scale. It's a great place to learn about beer because, unlike a modern commercial brewery, you can see every step in the process for yourself. And, no one else has a Brewmaster ready to welcome visitors in period costume.\n\nIn the 1860s there were 155 registered breweries in Ontario, and countless smaller operations. Black Creek Historic Brewery is the first in this province to replicate the brewing processes of that era, when there was no electricity or refrigeration, no stainless steel tanks or bottling plants.\n\nThe equipment at Black Creek Historic Brewery is made mainly of wood and copper, and the beer ferments the way it was done in the old days, with wooden barrels to age the beer. Malted barley is shoveled by hand into the wort tun where it is boiled into a mash. After filtering the solids through a linen cloth, the sugary liquid is boiled and hops are added, both for flavouring and as a natural preservative. Once the boiling is complete, the beer is put in barrels where the yeast is added. A short time later, the beer is ready!\n\nVisitors can sample the beer at cellar temperature, the way it was enjoyed in the past, or drink a chilled pint in the pub, the way many people prefer it today. Either way, you’ll be tasting the authentic flavours of ales and porters made by hand, using only natural ingredients and genuine period recipes.\n\nVisit the Black Creek Historic Brewery. It’s interesting. It’s fun. And the beer is great!"], ["imgUrl", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Cl1sHc/upload_WVifE0-medium.png"], ["website", "http://www.blackcreekbrewery.ca/"], ["loc", "Ontario"], ["created_at", "2016-07-31 02:11:36.693191"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-31 02:11:36.693191"]]

(In North America hard cider is an alcoholic drink made from fermented apple juice.) Carefully crafted from the best apples grown on our family farm and nearby orchards, our ciders are made with 100% pure apple juice.\n\nLocated on the picturesque island of Prince Edward County in Southeastern Ontario, our tasting room and retail store welcomes visitors from May to November. Come visit us or look for County Cider Co. products at restaurants, bars and LCBO stores\n\nThe County Cider Company is located on Ontario’s island of Prince Edward County. Most famous for the giant sand dunes and golden beaches of Sandbanks Provincial Park, the County also enjoys a dramatic history.\n\nFollowing the American Revolution of 1776 the Township of Marysburgh—home to the County Cider Co.—was one of many established for the settlement of United Empire Loyalists. Named in honour of Princess Mary, a daughter of King George III, it became home to a small group of disbanded German mercenaries under former Lieutenant Baron von Reitzenstein. This party, numbering about 40 persons, was one of the earliest German-speaking groups to settle in Ontario. By October 1784 they had begun to clear and cultivate the land. Henry David and his wife Elizabeth were among these early settlers and it was in 1830, that their son Conrad David, was given title to the lot, which the County Cider Co. now calls home.\n\nconradhouseToday, the 1832 Conrad David House is an area landmark. Set on the brow of the Waupoos escarpment, the stone house is an excellent example of Regency Cottage architecture. It features dramatic French doors, over-sized windows and veranda as well as a hipped roof. Next door, the property’s picturesque 1832 stone barn houses the County Cider Co.’s tasting room and retail store. Visitors are invited to take advantage of the million-dollar view of Lake Ontario from our patio and enjoy a cold, refreshing cider and a light lunch."], ["imgUrl", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/X2f0T4/upload_dor90I-medium.png"], ["website", "https://www.countycider.com"], ["loc", "Ontario"], ["created_at", "2016-07-31 02:11:41.480798"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-31 02:11:41.480798"]]

The concept was simple: make a variety of beers that WE wanted to drink and create a tasting opportunity for our customers to come into the brewery to decide what they liked, and buy to go.\n\nDuring our first year of operation we released over 20 different beers, underwent one expansion, and our MO remains the same as it was in the beginning. In addition to the retail store our beers can also be found in over 30 local bars and restaurants.\n\nYou can be sure when you pick up a glass or bottle of our beer that you’re drinking a fresh local product. We work that little old brew house like a pack mule to crank out as much beer as possible. Nearly all of our beer is sold to customers within a week of leaving our brite tanks. That’s freshness that’s hard to find elsewhere."], ["imgUrl", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/0lwJsD/upload_wBbw8Q-medium.png"], ["website", "http://www.beyondthepale.ca"], ["loc", "Ontario"], ["created_at", "2016-07-31 02:11:53.070766"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-31 02:11:53.070766"]]

In small villages across Europe, it was the local brewer that filled the vessels of pubs and cafés with beer made from his own closely guarded recipes. With the advent of industrialization, however, local breweries all but disappeared, bringing to an end the era of the authentic microbrewery.\n\nTwenty years ago, a family of brewers decided to revive the traditions of the past that were deeply rooted in three generations of their family – thus the name The 3 Brewers – “three” for three generations of brewing tradition. The 3 Brewers opened its very first microbrewery restaurant in Place de la Gare à Lille in 1986. Since then operations have expanded to 28 locations in France as well as several restaurants in other parts of the world including Quebec and soon Ontario.\n\nLes 3 Brasseurs' success can be attributed to a unique concept: Fresh non-pasteurized beer made from the purest ingredients and from traditional recipes – all brewed right at the heart of each of our restaurants for patrons to see."], ["imgUrl", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1AH8nV/upload_47XK2t-medium.png"], ["website", "http://www.les3brasseurs.com/"], ["loc", "Ontario"], ["created_at", "2016-07-31 02:12:29.083883"], ["updated_at", "2016-07-31 02:12:29.083883"]]

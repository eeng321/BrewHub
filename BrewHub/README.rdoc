Accomplished in this iteration so far

Account creation
* Accounts contain id, email, username, bcrypt(salt and hash), and a userRole which will contain either 1 for admin or 0 for normal user. Currently this is set at account creation but the best way to accomplish "privledge escalation" would be to have one "root" user who can grant "admin" to others.

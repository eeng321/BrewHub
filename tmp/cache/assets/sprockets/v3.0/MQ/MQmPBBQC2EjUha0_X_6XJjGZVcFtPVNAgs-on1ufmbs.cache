The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grains‚Äîmost commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation.;T:metadata{	:dependencieso:Set:

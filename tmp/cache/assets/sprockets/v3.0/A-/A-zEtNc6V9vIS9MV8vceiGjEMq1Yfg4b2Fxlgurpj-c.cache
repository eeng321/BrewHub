The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsâ€”most commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation.;T:metadata{	:dependencieso:Set:

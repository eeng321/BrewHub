Overview

BrewHub is a social web application for users (19+) to share their appreciation for craft beer. Independent breweries are becoming increasingly popular, and this app provides users with a convenient way to learn about local breweries, local beer, and new styles of beers.  BrewHubâ€™s meet-up feature allows users to easily create groups and invite their friends; once in a group, users have access to a chat where they can discuss the details of their plans and select a destination. An administrative interface provides the abilities of banning abusive users, creating new administrators, and to alter a user's account if necessary.

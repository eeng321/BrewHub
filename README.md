Overview

BrewHub is a social web application for users (19+) to share their appreciation for craft beer. Independent breweries are becoming increasingly popular, and this app will provide users with a convenient way to track, rate, and review what they've tried and what they want to try. More importantly, BrewHub will facilitate new friendships between beer-lovers through a meet-up feature. Users will be matched based upon their given availability and location. Once the group is formed the members will vote on app-suggested pubs in their listed location. Users will also have the option to create private or public events at a specific time and place. To make sure users can get home safely after their event, the application will include information with the TransLink API for trip planning.

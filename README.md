Project Overview (Iteration 3) - BrewHub

Group 4: Trevor Gale, Janice Moat, Edmond Eng, Henry Zhao, Jonathan Loewen

Overview

BrewHub is a social web application for users (19+) to share their appreciation
for craft beer. Independent breweries are becoming increasingly popular, and
this app provides users with a convenient way learn about beer and discover new
styles. More importantly, BrewHubâ€™s meet-up feature allows users to easily create
groups and invite their friends; once in a group users have access to a chat
where they can discuss the details of their plans. An administrative interface
provides the ability to ban users for abuse, to create a new admin, and to alter
a user's account if necessary.

  <a><h5>About Us</h5></a>
    <p>
        BrewHub is a social web application for users (19+) to share their
        appreciation for craft beer.

        If you're new to beer or just want to learn the difference between
        a stout and a porter, check out our <a href="/beers/"><b>Beer 101</b></a>
        page.

        Once you've got the basics, check where you can find your
        favourite <a href="/beers/"><b>Style</b></a> on tap, or see what
        your local <a href="/pubs/"><b>Breweries</b></a> are carrying.

        Ready to hit the pub? Get <a href="#"><b>Social</b></a> and bring
        some friends! Make a group and choose from the breweries near you, or
        select your own.

Wheat beer is a beer, usually top-fermented, which is brewed with a large proportion of wheat relative to the amount of malted barley which makes a light coloured beer. The two main varieties are Weissbier and Witbier; minor types include Lambic, Berliner Weisse and Gose.  Often made with raw unmalted wheat, as opposed to the talted wheat used in other varieties.

Lager is a type of beer that is conditioned at low temperatures, normally in cold storage at the brewery, before being delivered to the consumer. It may be pale, amber, or dark. Although the defining feature of lager beer is its maturation in cold storage, it is also distinguished by the use of bottom-fermenting lager yeast.

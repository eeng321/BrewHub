Pale ale is a beer made by warm fermentation using predominantly pale malt. The higher proportion of pale malts results in a lighter colour. The term 'pale ale' first appeared around 1703 for beers made from malts dried with coke, which resulted in a lighter colour than other beers popular at that time. Different brewing practices and hop levels have resulted in a range of taste and strength within the pale ale family.
